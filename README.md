# Cybersec-101
A guide on how to safely use the internet and computers for the common man

- Spam email phishing
  - Microsoft Email vulnerability used to allow XSS attacks, but now its safe to view spam mail (althought you should NEVER click any unknown links)
  - Phishing is when a fake website impersonates a real website in order to steal the victim's credentials 
  
- Websites
  - Certificate Authorities and SSL
  Use of Public Private Key encryption verifies that the website belongs to that organization 
  - HTTP vs HTTPS
  The S stands for secured, meaning your information is encrypted. Packets sent to a HTTP website can be intercepted and viewed raw
  - HTTP Cookies
  Local files on your computer that distinguish it from the other computers in your network
  - Password creation and storage
  Create passwords that don't contain dictionary words (1337 speak). Use numbers, letters (cap and lower), and symbols. Never use the same password twice (even on different plataforms). Never establish a pattern that potential hackers could use. 
  USE A PASSWORD MANAGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  - 2-factor authentication
  While it can be a little tedious, it greatly enhances personal security. Use your phone (SMS, email, or device [google]). Consider using U2F key or QR
